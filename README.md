# web_dev_portfolio

My portfolio for my web based projects.

As an advancing web developer I have been able to create a few projects and am still updating them as time goes by.

I have been able to create projects like:

    Calculator

    Sports Websites

    Cereal shop UI

    Basketball Academy UI

    Random Quote Generator

    Book Library

    Flight Booking UI

    Portfolio template

and many more!

I have used languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, BOOTSTRAP, BULMA

Cereal shop is an e-commerce website whose frontend has been written using HTML and CSS while the backend has been written using PHP. It was tested using MySQL database. Further functionality to be added soon !!
